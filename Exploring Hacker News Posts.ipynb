For Show posts, the hour that received the most comments were Thursday 7:00 and Saturday 8:00. So if we want to balance between points and reviews, 8 AM on Saturday seems to be the best time for a Show post. <p>"

So it depends on what type of engagement we want to achieve, we can choose to post an Ask post or a Show post accordingly. \n",
