# Finding best time to post a new topic on Hacker News website

Hacker News is a popular site among startup and technology circles, where people can post stories and receive votes and comments from others. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Similarly, users submit Show HN posts to share a project, product, or something interesting. All other types of posts are captured under Other.

In this project, we focus on answering the following two questions:
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more points and comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more points and comments on average?
